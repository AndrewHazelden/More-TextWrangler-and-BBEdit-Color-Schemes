More TextWrangler and BBEdit Color Schemes
by Andrew Hazelden


This is a collection of Color Schemes I have created for Bare Bones Software's TextWrangler and BBEdit text editors.

Currently I have created two custom color schemes:
Charcoal
Midnight Blue


What is a Color Scheme?
When you are writing software on a computer you have to stare at text for hours on end. A color scheme allows you to customize the color of the text and the background in your documents. 


Software Required:

BBEdit

TextWrangler

If you are running Mountain Lion and the Color Schemes folder doesn't exist you can create the folders manually.

One way to create the folders is to use the terminal program and run the command:
  mkdir -p ~/"Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Color Schemes/"
