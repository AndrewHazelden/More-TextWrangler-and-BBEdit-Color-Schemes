More TextWrangler and BBEdit Color Schemes
by Andrew Hazelden


This is a collection of Color Schemes I have created for Bare Bones Software's TextWrangler and BBEdit text editors.

Currently I have created two custom color schemes:
Charcoal
Midnight Blue


What is a Color Scheme?
When you are writing software on a computer you have to stare at text for hours on end. A color scheme allows you to customize the color of the text and the background in your documents.
